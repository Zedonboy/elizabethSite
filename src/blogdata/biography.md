### EARLY LIFE

Our mother, Elizabeth Mgbechikwelu Ilo nee Obiajulu was born on October 05, 1938 to late Josiah and late Celina Obiajulu of Umuabani village Neni, Anambra state.  She is the first child of her parents. She was baptized on 27th October 1938, received her first holy communion on 14th April, 1950 and had her confirmation on 7th December ,1953. she started her primary school in Neni, where she got her standard six certificate, after which she went to live in Ontisha with her maternal Uncle, Late Mr. Clement Adinma of Umukabia village, Neni. At Ontisha, she secured a job at Otibros, a textile company there she worked until she met and fell in love with her Husband, Francis Obiora Ilo of Ezioko village, Oko. Elizabeth got married to her heartthrob on 9th December 1967. Towards the end of the Civil war, they relocated to Enugu to build their family. They had their 25th/silver wedding anniversary on 28th September 1992 and their 50th/ Golden Jubilee celebration on 17th September 2017.

### RELIGIOUS LIFE

---

Office as she was fondly called was a devoted and dedicated Christian, a staunch catholic, an ardent admirer of our Blessed virgin Mary. she was a very strong member of St Anthony society and block rosary crusade.

Mrs. Ilo was also a member of the confraternity of Christian mothers and the catholic women organization and was given the prestigious Ezinne title in recognition of her contributions to the church. Mummy lived a good Christian life. She left no stone unturned in her pursuit for heaven. She was very prayerful. She starts her day with early morning devotion which  comprises  the chaplet of the Blessed virgin Mary , Saint Anthony’s chaplet and Thank you Jesus chaplet as early as 3.30am  those she prays alone before she wakes all of us  for  the family group prayer of Holy Rosary and other accompanying prayers.

Sing-song every Sunday evening from 7pm to 8pm was sacrosanct in our Enugu home.  The singsong was introduced and conducted by mummy till her departure.  sing-song is a forum where all the children in our compound gather in our sitting room, for plenty sing song praises, prayers,  reflections of  that Sunday readings , catechism  and  moral instructions . mum in agreement with her hubby, provided space in their Enugu premises, for celebration of masses every Sunday and for morning masses and masses every day of obligation. She was honored with a 'life membership' of Roman Catholic church.

### CAREER/BUSINESS LIFE

---

Madam Elizabeth was focused, organized and intelligent. She was  very industrious and  had her hands on so many businesses which ranged from managing a big time supermarket, to pure water production ,to  poultry and farming , to  event decoration  others include , hiring of cooking utensils , to being a cook in big time events, and to running of  a restaurant. She was the proud owner of New life super Market, a household name back then in Enugu, a business she did till her demise. Her agility was unstoppable. Mummy never lacked financially, she did well for herself

### AS A WIFE AND MOTHER

---

Mummy continued calling her husband, DARLING, from the inception of their marriage till her death.  That name ‘Darling’ which mum calls dad is also a name, our dad is likely to additionally regret to stop hearing. Character wise, mum was superb. I cannot remember her talking Back to my father or raising her voice while daddy talked.  She ensured that my dad was served his meals on time, and that her children, guests, and other dependents have theirs too. She did not spare the cane in bringing up her children or any child that came under her care. Yet you could not find a more caring and dotting mother.  Her relationship with her in laws and other distant relations too are worth noting. Mum was accommodating. I cannot correctly count how many people, she accepted in her home. Right from when l was very young till l became independent as an adult. So many students that are our relations were sheltered  to attend schools, so many more got accommodated to visit hospitals because they were sick, some have come to pursue their businesses for some time from her house, she sheltered them all. Mrs. Elizabeth Ilo, had a beautiful heart. She identifies with the needy, the weak and the helpless. she would always share without minding the cost. I can remember her visits to prison, motherless homes, hospitals to visit people we were not related to. She was a Peaceful, loving, and caring woman. She was accessible and philanthropic. Mrs. Ilo is an epitome of an ideal woman.

### SOCIAL LIFE

---

Mama was an extrovert and belonged to a few social and friendship organizations.  She comfortably lead women in various organizations. She was a member of  CWO both in Oko and in Enugu, Umu Ada Neni, Oko progressive Union, Church zones, Confraternity of Christian Mothers and so on. Our mum, was an orator, outspoken and eloquent. Mama rocked during her time.
Mama was strong, agile, and well-articulated before her death. she had always prayed she does not get so sick as not to help herself nor so sick that she becomes a discomfort to people around her. And so, it pleased God to honor her sincere wish and call her when he did, answering her humble request.
