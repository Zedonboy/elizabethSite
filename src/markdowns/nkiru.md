I know that one day the sun will set, but I did not expect it this soon. Why set when it is not yet evening? Mummy has worked and ought to enjoy the fruits of her sweat, but sadly it is already night. So, when I call this weekend and it rings, mummy will not pick at the other end?

I have just got back from work. I have hardly finished refreshing when my phone rang. It was Oby, my  sister in law amidst sobs she said, “ Aunty Nkiru, I don’t know what to say, Mummy, Mummy , it is Mummy" and I said yes, Mummy, what happened, then  my worst  fears were laid bare  before me, "Mummy has gone to be with Jesus” I was speechless. Earlier that day uche had informed me Mama was rushed to Hospital and I immediately put a call across to daddy and he said mama is fine, she is responding to treatment , she has suggested coming back home, but the Doctor said , he needs to keep an eye on her for the rest of  the day and promised she will be discharged tomorrow, But then there was no tomorrow, Mummy did not come home again.
Okennem, if it pleases God, it pleases me. Am consoled, because I know, things do not just happen to children of God. Anything that happens is a part of a wonderful plan. The troubles, reverses, the sorrows, the rod are strokes of the great sculptor’s hand. Can we think it pleases his loving heart to cause us a moment’s Pain? Oh, No!  he sees through the present and knows exactly what is best for us. No physician ever weighed out medicine to his patient with half as much care and exactness as God weighs out to us every trial. Not one grain too much does he ever permit to be placed in the scale. Am at peace because God is aware and has allowed it.

Adieu super Mama, am certain you are seated with the saints. our dearest Mother Virgin Mary whom you have advocated so very well is now your host, enjoy Mummy. I can boast too you have seen and felt saint Anthony of Padua. Nwuye Darlyn, Mama anyi , Nnedinma jee nke oma. Anyi fulu gi n’anya mana Chukwu fulu gi karia.
