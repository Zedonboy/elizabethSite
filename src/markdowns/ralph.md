“OUR LOSS, Heaven’s Gain”
Death has never been known to be a friend and most unwelcomed visitor to many families. That was our experience on 11th January 2021 when Mama Ngizi, my brothers wife, my Amaka, Omaricham passed on to glory.

Truth, I got the shocking sad news in the morning hours of 12th January 2021, but it was at night when I laid down to sleep that I felt the impact of the death. The reality of her passing on to eternity became apparent, the vacuum which her death had created became clear and the actual pain came.

Though she looked “Frail” like some diabetics do when last we were together on the 3rd of January 2021, but not such as to think of a sudden death.

Mama Ngozi, Omaricham was a peace loving woman. She lived a peaceful life and preached peace to all around her. Her peace loving virtue came to full manifestation during the last few hours of her existence. She quietly and peacefully slept on to the Lord.

The death of a loved one is undoubtablly a great and sad loss but we take solance in the fact that Mama Ngozi lived a rewarding and fulfilled life worthy of emulation. This fact should always console us.

Mama Ngozi, Omaricham was a very creative, hardworking and industrious woman. She was very humble, simple and modest at its best.
Omaricham, Madam Office, Ezinne and Madam Peace, because I cannot change the will of God, I say “FAREWELL”. As your body is committed to the mother earth today, it is my avowed prayer that God shall welcome your soul in his divine bosom where happiness and joy know no bounds.

May your gentle soul rest in perfect peace, Amen!!!
