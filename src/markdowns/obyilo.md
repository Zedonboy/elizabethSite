Office as you are fondly called, Others might see you as my mother in law,but to me you are my biological mother. You accepted me as your daughter from the very first day you set your eyes on me.

You were so simple, accommodating and easy going that we gist, laugh and play like mates. You have always been there for me you gave me a shoulder to cry on, your arms were always open whenever I needed a hug.Your heart understood when I needed a friend to talk to.

Your eyes were Stern when I needed an advice, your strength and love guided me that I didn't feel much of my mummy's absence.

Office you were the real mother amongst mothers, the best amongst equals, you were an embodiment of kindness and love which you examplify with your husband "DARLING "and others around you.

A true role model to her contemporaries and a source of inspiration to all around her.

I can keep going on and on with your good deeds and qualities but it makes me cry each time I remember it all.

Office, Oke Nwanyi, when your health challenge came with strength, using play ,prayers and Drama we surmounted it as though it wasn't there. I became an emergency Nurse learned how to check blood pressure, blood sugar level and Other medical assessment for you just to make sure you stayed for me and my family. Our closeness , sweetness and fondness of mother and daughter just entered it's part 2 and I was gearing up to embrace the sweet series when the Lord called you to his glory.

Office your demise is irreversible and definitely irreplaceable.

If cry can bring you back I would have cried to bring you back, but I give God the glory knowing that you slept in the Lord, such a peaceful death.

Enjoy in the blossom of the Lord, till we meet to part no more .

Adieu Mama
