Life is a stage !!!

It is with deep sense of sorrow and regret that we the entire members of Sir/Nze & Lady J.M. Anyado family feel your unexpected demise.

Madam Ilo-Franco (Office Nwanyi)  was a very industrious, optimistic woman, she was quite unassuming and extremely kind.

You truly were special to us. Hence we sat down explored and calculated your relationship with our family, you were a good and rare neigbour. Thank you for your sacrifices. Such you bored our disturbances, your care and concern as  you peeped through the window from time to time to comment with positive utterances whenever something good dropped into our compound; your generosity as we shared your delicacies; your everwarmth "Good morning, how are the kids" that showed extreme love from a good neigbour. Also, you sympathized with us in times of sorrow. Infact your positive attitude is countless - "Office Nwanyi"

However, we give glory to the Almighty for your life on earth, it is also our prayer that our Lord will grant your soul eternal rest, give the family of Chief Ilo Franco the fortitude to bear the irreparable loss.
Adieu Mrs. Elizabeth Ilo-Franco
Adieu Office Nwanyi till we meet in the paradise.

## Sir/Nze & Lady J.M. Anyado
