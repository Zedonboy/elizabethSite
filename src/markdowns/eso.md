A Virtuous woman to behold you were.
My mummy, Mrs Elizabeth Mgbechikwelu ILO, you were a wonderful and benevolent nature made woman, caring, faithful, God fearing, industrious, peace loving, super support to my daddy, sociable, devoted, eloquent public speaker, women leader, accommodative, responsible, organizer to mention but these. The list of your good works and attributes are inexhaustible. Particularly, out of your good works was your steady visits to the sick in hospitals, visits to prisoners, motherless babies homes, less privileged and orphanages. You lived a life worth emulating in all ramifications. Mum, you brought us up in the way of the Lord and guided us through following Christ and his teachings till the end of time. My mummy, l appreciate also your super support to my father, in seeing that my siblings and l were soundly trained academically, and we are all good to go. Mum, l can categorically say, that in your life sojourn, you left no stone unturned in all you were expected to achieve while on earth.

Gone soon, my prayers for you were to live longer, but it pleases God to take you his daughter now.

Office umuagbara, you were popularly called, you will always answer - 'Anom na nsom'.
The English translation means:
I am on my track/line.

It pleases God that you get off your track physically, on earth, but on the heaven line, you are undoubtedly on your track, infact you have arrived Heaven. I thank God for you, my mum, for life well spent.
Mummy, you did not even give me sign you were leaving me forever, when l came during the Christmas/New year celebration 2020/2021 to be with you and daddy at Oko, also down to Enugu for more than 2 weeks before your demise. Just 2 days l left back to my base, you passed on. I was privileged to have been with you to your few last days on earth.

'Oh death, where is thy sting'.

You have stolen my lovely mother and my heart bleeds.

Can l be able to endure this your departure from me forever. I have accepted my fate that you, my mum, is no more because God said it will be so. Nobody can question God's authority. Mummy, good bye, we parted to meet again. As death is a necessary end, God when l die, please qualify me to meet my mother in heaven.
My mummy, you have left 'Uso', your third daughter, 'O tua ka osi masi chukwu'. I will keep praying for the repose of your soul, and that through the mercy of God your soul rests in perfect peace, Amen. Mummy, cause of my joy, please join our blessed mother Mary, in interceding for us.
When you came for 'Omugwo' on my two children, you over proved yourself 'a sweet mother'.

Mum, l cannot also forget some of your frequent peace sayings in your relationship with people. They include;

- Wetuo Obi, meaning:Take it easy or mellow your mind down.
- Welu Obi ofoo, meaning: Be patient.

- Obi ofoo nyiri nga, meaning: Patience subdues staying in prison or finding oneself in a difficult situation

- Mmiri ezoro taa chiaka rika, meaning: There is always tomorrow for an event to take place Or There is hope for tomorrow

- ife Chukwu si na mmadu ga abu, ya ka o ga abu, meaning: What God says that a person would be, that is what the person will be.

- Ihe onye ga abu, chi ya amalu goo, meaning: God already knows everybodys' destiny, which he made to be.

-Enwero nke agulu agu zuru ezu(Nothing is perfect)

- Gba nkiti or
  Gba kene nkiti(Leave off or calm down).

They sooth the mind and calm temper.  
On that fateful Monday, 11th January 2021, in the afternoon of that day, l heard my mummy was not feeling well and has been rushed to the hospital by my daddy. I quickly called my dad. On asking my dad about my mum's health position, he said that 'they are with the doctor, that doctor was attending to mum'. I said to him, l pray that mum recovers very fast, he replied he prays so too.

Feeling worried about how mum was responding to treatment, at about 7.30pm that same day, l called daddy and asked him, where he was, he told me that he was in his room at home. Daddy reached home after doctor attended to mummy and mum was on the hospital bed asleep. I told him, daddy, please, l want you to go to the hospital now and know how mummy was doing and request for doctor's attention if doctor was not rightly attending to mummy then. I later learnt that my mum passed on about 6.30pm ( When God's trumpet blew for her), while my call to daddy to hasten up to the hospital was about 7.30pm. In few minutes, l got the news of the demise of my mum, if wailing can wake one whose soul has gone to the great beyond, my mum would definitely have woke. It was to me that it can't be real, it can't be the truth. I started imagining not ever seeing my mum again, it was to me as if my brain was not together again. I started and continued sobbing and wailing uncontrollably from outside home where l was then, till l got home. At home l continued, incessantly l cry. Even when I remember my phone can ring and it would never be my mum calling me, to know how l am doing as you always do, neither can l ever call you mum on phone again, it lowers my spirit and makes me feel extra bad.

I get consoled on the fact that my mum who was heaven's candidate on earth has at passing on, made heaven.

Adieu, My Sweet Mummy

l Miss You

Rest in Perfect Peace

Mummy, keep glorifying God with the angels and saints in heaven.

It is well with your soul.

Your beloved
