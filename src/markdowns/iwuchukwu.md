Dear Nkiru,

In this time of uncertainty in the world over when families take solace in supporting and encouraging one another, the loss of a dear one can be very devastating especially someone who brings sunshine to her family. The Holy Spirit who is the comforter will comfort you and your entire family. God will fill the vacuum your mum left in the heart of your dad (her soul mate), He will strengthen him all the days of his life in Jesus name. Please accept our condolences.
