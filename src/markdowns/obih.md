## CONDOLENCES

It is with a heavy heart that I, and my family, received the painful news of the passing of your beloved mother, Late, Lolo Elizabeth Ilo.

It is a cause of great sorrow to us and especially to you the children and entire family, but we can take solace in the fact that 'Office' as she was fondly called, was a consummate Christian in life, a great mother, Role Model and Mentor to a lot people.

Even though the cold grip of death has taken her away from us, I want you to take solace in the fact that she lived a good life.
I pray that God grants you the fortitude to bear this loss and May the soul of Late Lolo Elizabeth 'office' Ilo and souls all faithful departed, through the mercy of God rest in peace.

Please accept our condolences.
