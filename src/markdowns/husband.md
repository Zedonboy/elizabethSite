My darling wife, my adviser, my best friend, my confidant, my prayer partner, my business partner in short my everything. Your death has dealt me a hard blow.

The pains this has caused in my heart, I do not know when it will heal. I ask God to comfort me.
When I remember how you came into my life, how we do things and carry the home together, how we settle challenges, how we keep each other company, my heart bleeds.

Nwunyem, Mama Ngozi, Madam, am accepting God’s will, but it is so very difficult for me, to accept I will not see you here again.
Ezigbo nwunyem jee nke oma.
Ezumike di okpu nye nwunyem O Dinwenu anyi,
Ka ife nke ndu ebebe chakwasI ya
Ka mkpuru obi Elizabeth Ilo n’ mkpuru obi ndi nile kwelunu galu aga
Site n’ebere nke chukwu welu zuru ike n’ndokwa  Amen
