Ochie Dike nnem…..

A great Iroko has fallen
Our dear mother has gone to the world beyond.

Office Oke nwanyi is gone forever from this world filled with sickness, hardship, bitterness to meet with her Maker where joy reigns forever.

Madam Elizabeth Ilo (Office oke nwanyi) depicts an example of a virtuos woman.

Let me take all to memory lane because we know the woman in question very well.

Madam Elizabeth Ilo (a k a Office nwanyi) is our mother while growing up as children (nne anyi). We all lived like one family in one compound all because of our dear Landlady. Every Sunday she will organize evening Sunday school for the children, for prayers and bible teachings.

She never misses morning masses with the family. Last Saturday of every month, she organizes sanitation for the entire flats to ensure that the compound is neat and tidy. Remember those years she will go to farm with the family and during harvest, she will be generous to share with the tenants.

Motherhood exhumes in her blood. As kids then we remember Sunday morning masses when she will ask us questions relating to the readings and gospel after church to ensure we participate actively in the church service.

Office Oke nwanyi will be greatly missed not only by her biological children but by most of us that stayed closed to her as kids till now.

Thank you Mummy, those teachings helped to mould and prepared us for the future. The earth will miss a rare gem but heaven will gain a beautiful soul.

The news of your demise on……..January 2021 came as a rude shock to our family. We thought it was a dream that will never come to reality.

Alas!!! We were wrong when confirmed from Uchenna, Nkiru and even daddy to be true.
Mama Landlord as Chisom will call her will ever live in our hearts because you have left an indelible mark that will not be erased easily.

Adieu Darling Papa Tochukwu

Jee nke oma Office Oke nwanyi…

May the good Lord receive your soul

Amen

## Sir Richard Nnadi & Family.
