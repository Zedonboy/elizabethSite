A VIRTOUS AND WORTHY MOTHER.

Mama, you impacted everyone around you happily all through your life. You never turned your back on anyone, as you viewed everybody around you as family including your children's friends which I can testify.
Sweet mother, you never complained about the burden of helping out and caring for people. This virtue made you a rare GEM. A mother with a difference! Though, you are gone but your good works still speak loud and clear and it will continue to speak for your beloved ones especially your children. You are much loved even in death. May GOD bless and rest your gentle soul. Adieu, MAMA OFFICE!

### TRIBUTE TO MADAM ELIZABETH ILO

"If we live, we live to the Lord, and if we die, we die to the Lord, so then, whether we live or whether we die,we are the Lord's." Romans 14: 8
Mama Ngozi lived and died as a woman of God. She always started her day, very early, with her family and whosoever is within her household, with the Family Rosary followed by the morning Mass( until age slowed her down).

She invested all the gifts endowed in her by the Almighty God on her children and all who crossed her path. Her commitment to excellence, generosity and sacrifice can be attested by all who knew her.

Strength and dignity were her clothing..... and she never ate the bread of idleness. Proverbs 31: 25, 27.

Adieu! Great woman!!

Rest in peace until we meet again.

### TRIBUTE TO MY DEAREST AUNT

The news of your demise left me completely devastated. It‚Äôs quite difficult to fathom that you have gone forever. However, sweet memories fill my heart anytime I remember your benevolence and hospitality. You are indeed the epitome of motherhood and love. About two weeks ago before your death, you came to Neni to commiserate with some bereaved families, unknown that you came to bid final farewell to your ancestral home. Oh! What an irreparable loss!

My dearest aunt, your death has left a deep void in my heart which time may not be able to heal. I remember as a child, how we used to visit you every ‚Äúmothering Sunday‚Äù. Your attention and love to me and my siblings was second to none. I would also not forget in a hurry each time I came to your shop, the fabulous entertainment with glorious food and an endless supply of my most favourite drink and snack. How I wish I could have stopped you, Oh death! My sweet aunt, you left a true legacy that will remain indelible in our hearts. You are a rare gem and will forever be loved and cherished. May your soul find repose in the bosom of the Lord till we meet to part no more.

Adieu sweet Aunt! Adieu Office!!

TRIBUTE TO MAMA NKIRUKA AKA MADAM ELIZABETH MGBECHIKWELU ILO nee OBIAJULU

The news of Mama‚Äôs call to Glory came to me with mixed feelings, Sadness and Joy. I was Sad as a Mortal because Mama is no more with us on earth but I was Joyful, Mama is with the Lord in Heaven. She was Soul and Body for Christ Jesus.

Mama lived a God Fearing Life, while on Earth for 83years. She was a Leader and an Active member in most Religious and Social Organizations.

The God of Mama blessed her with six lovely Biological Children of which there are Academic Doctors, chartered Accountant , Banker etc.

Mummy Elizabeth was happily married for 53 years. Her 50th wedding anniversary was celebrated in September, 2017  to the Glory of God.

I may not know Mama very well but her daughter, Mrs Nkiruka Nwafor n√©e Ilo, is well known to me in her place of work  for more than 14 years. I was her first boss when she was engaged in 2001 at PH.

She is Dedicated, Honest, Loyal, willing to Learn and quite Appreciative even as I am no longer in Service. 

This character is rare in our clime. It may be a Trait from her late mother. 

Mama Nkiruka was Peace Loving which translated to how she was called to Glory on that  Fateful day. The illness that made her to be called by God was less than 12hours. What a Peaceful way to depart our sinful world.

Mama Nkiruka , I Pray for your soul to Rest in Perfect Peace.
