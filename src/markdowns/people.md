A VIRTOUS AND WORTHY MOTHER.

Mama, you impacted everyone around you happily all through your life. You never turned your back on anyone, as you viewed everybody around you as family including your children's friends which I can testify.
Sweet mother, you never complained about the burden of helping out and caring for people. This virtue made you a rare GEM. A mother with a difference! Though, you are gone but your good works still speak loud and clear and it will continue to speak for your beloved ones especially your children. You are much loved even in death. May GOD bless and rest your gentle soul. Adieu, MAMA OFFICE!

### TRIBUTE TO MADAM ELIZABETH ILO

"If we live, we live to the Lord, and if we die, we die to the Lord, so then, whether we live or whether we die,we are the Lord's." Romans 14: 8
Mama Ngozi lived and died as a woman of God. She always started her day, very early, with her family and whosoever is within her household, with the Family Rosary followed by the morning Mass( until age slowed her down).

She invested all the gifts endowed in her by the Almighty God on her children and all who crossed her path. Her commitment to excellence, generosity and sacrifice can be attested by all who knew her.

Strength and dignity were her clothing..... and she never ate the bread of idleness. Proverbs 31: 25, 27.

Adieu! Great woman!!

Rest in peace until we meet again.

### TRIBUTE TO MY DEAREST AUNT

The news of your demise left me completely devastated. It‚Äôs quite difficult to fathom that you have gone forever. However, sweet memories fill my heart anytime I remember your benevolence and hospitality. You are indeed the epitome of motherhood and love. About two weeks ago before your death, you came to Neni to commiserate with some bereaved families, unknown that you came to bid final farewell to your ancestral home. Oh! What an irreparable loss!

My dearest aunt, your death has left a deep void in my heart which time may not be able to heal. I remember as a child, how we used to visit you every ‚Äúmothering Sunday‚Äù. Your attention and love to me and my siblings was second to none. I would also not forget in a hurry each time I came to your shop, the fabulous entertainment with glorious food and an endless supply of my most favourite drink and snack. How I wish I could have stopped you, Oh death! My sweet aunt, you left a true legacy that will remain indelible in our hearts. You are a rare gem and will forever be loved and cherished. May your soul find repose in the bosom of the Lord till we meet to part no more.

Adieu sweet Aunt! Adieu Office!!

TRIBUTE TO MAMA NKIRUKA AKA MADAM ELIZABETH MGBECHIKWELU ILO nee OBIAJULU

The news of Mama‚Äôs call to Glory came to me with mixed feelings, Sadness and Joy. I was Sad as a Mortal because Mama is no more with us on earth but I was Joyful, Mama is with the Lord in Heaven. She was Soul and Body for Christ Jesus.

Mama lived a God Fearing Life, while on Earth for 83years. She was a Leader and an Active member in most Religious and Social Organizations.

The God of Mama blessed her with six lovely Biological Children of which there are Academic Doctors, chartered Accountant , Banker etc.

Mummy Elizabeth was happily married for 53 years. Her 50th wedding anniversary was celebrated in September, 2017 to the Glory of God.

I may not know Mama very well but her daughter, Mrs Nkiruka Nwafor n√©e Ilo, is well known to me in her place of work for more than 14 years. I was her first boss when she was engaged in 2001 at PH.

She is Dedicated, Honest, Loyal, willing to Learn and quite Appreciative even as I am no longer in Service.

This character is rare in our clime. It may be a Trait from her late mother.

Mama Nkiruka was Peace Loving which translated to how she was called to Glory on that Fateful day. The illness that made her to be called by God was less than 12hours. What a Peaceful way to depart our sinful world.

Mama Nkiruka , I Pray for your soul to Rest in Perfect Peace.

CELEBRATION OF HOMEWARD JOURNEY OF MADAM ELIZABETH MGBECHIKWELU ILO

I write on behalf of my family to condole with you on the death of your mother, Late Madam Elizabeth Mgbechikwelu Ilo. The permissiveness of God‚Äôs will has simply prevailed because through death we shall all be born to eternal life. Doctor Ilo, that is our prayer for her and hope that you mourn her death with wisdom from God.

Your quintessential mother who died, buried and is being mourn respectively came, saw and conquered. Remember, you are not alone in the loss. In your mother‚Äôs earthly good qualities which she wore like an amour, the people of Ezioko village, Oko in Orumba North Local Government Area of Anambra State and beyond mourn with you, your family, your friends, associates and other good people also mourn with you people too.

It is true we have lost a kind woman, a radiant woman, a rare gem, a loving and caring mother per-excellence. Yet, it does not call for crying like people without hope. Your major problem now is how to sustain the vacuum her death has created. The vacuum she left behind does not have the attribute associated with nothingness and emptiness. Rather, it is a vacuum where one can see things, hear things and feel things.

Chief Ilo Francis Obiora, be consoled as the angels in heaven will receive her in their heavenly kingdom where there is no more pain, sorrow or tears any more. A good mother to all, may your gentle soul rest in peace Amen.

## A Tribute to Our late Mother; Madam Elizabeth Ilo (Office).

In retrospect to our old days in the University, we usually assemble at your LIFE SUPERMARKET after tedious school runs, where you quietly abode, sitting, observing in hiding;running your daily business and family activities,attending to people and communicating with your best friend and husband in smile, signs and words.

I would fondly call you office, what would you want to take,
She will gently smile and said answered in tiny voice;
Nwa m, unu emeriena onwunwa nke taa; I would answer ; yes maa, She would order her little girl helper to offer us cold water and she would advice; I can offer you soft drinks and cold water but not alcohol.

Alcohol is very dangerous for students to consume, if students dare consume alcohol, they will lack in concentration.We would all laugh.

She is a virtuous mother with unquantifiable mother quality. She took all of us that flocked around her like her own children. She doesn't delve into our argument but sometimes tenders few lines of advice.

Office, you left us the day we were observing a wake keeping for our other mother; late Mrs Chinese Akunyili, whom possess same mother quality as you.

May our dear lord accept your soul and the soul of Mrs. Akunyili and may you both continue to rest peacefully in his care until we meet to part no more.

A tribute from your son

## Tribute To Mama Ngozi

O mama Ngozi, as we always referred to you; the news of your blessed departure was not for me a shock at first, because it is an unavoidable destiny that awaits all mortals, but how sudden it happened really dragged one to the edge of reflection. O what a funny world! How short a time here on earth!

Mama Ngozi, you came back this last Christmas and as usual encountered your people with your smiling face that attracts your admirers. Your sickness did not steal it from you. More still I spoke with you on phone few days before your death and you sounded healthy. To hear of your departure after few days presented to me the fragility of human nature.

You tried your best to be a good christian and your lot as a daughter of God is definitely to be in the bosom of the Lord. Matthew 5: 9 says ‚ÄúBlessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called children of God‚Äù. When I received the news of your blessed exit, this passage of the scripture flashed to my mind. Mama Ngozi, you were a peacemaker. You never left any stone unturned to see that unity and peace are upheld and maintained among your husband‚Äôs kinsmen. Your benevolent and charming smile stilled conflicting and coercive situation. You wisely used your charming smile to draw conflicting parties for reconciliation. What a model for married women. As ‚Äúnwaada‚Äù, you did not limit yourself to the Igbo adage that says: ‚ÄúEbe onye bi ka o na- awachi,‚Äù you stood as a beacon of unity and progress among your siblings. We pray that our Merciful Saviour to forgive any faults you committed due to human frailty and welcome you into paradise.

Mama Ngozi, we will surely miss your smile and peace-making attitude. You were a good wife and your death at this time is a huge loss to us, but we will hold on to all the memories we created together.  
Enjoy everlasting peace mama Ngozi!!
Adieu Office umunwanyi!!

The Ijomah family, sends their heartfelt condolences to each and everyone of the Ilo family.

With great sadness we mourn the death of your wife and mother. The ties that bind our families together goes beyond that of a mother-in-law.

With great affection we remember her generous and caring nature during the many times she visited our mother during her long years of illness.

In this time of darkness and challenge we stand in solidarity and grief by your side.¬† Your loss is our loss.
We thank God for her long life and the many ways he blessed us through her.
Although words may not fully convey the depth and breadth of this loss, we hope that you can derive some comfort from Jesus' promises that those that die in him will never truly die.

May the Almighty grant each of you the strength in this sad moment and the consolation that comes from knowing that your dear wife and mother is now enjoying eternal bliss in heaven.

### Tribute to my mum!

‚ÄúOffice‚Äù as I used to know her. My dear mum! I chatted with you shortly before you departed not knowing it would be the last.

Friends, I called her mum not because she was my biological mum, but because she exhibited every virtue and attributes of who I would call mum. I am proud to be one of your adopted daughters.

Mum, you were a very kind woman, full of life and actions, that positively impacted many lives including mine. I will always remember you for a lot of things. But the question is this- Will I ever forget the delicious Ora soup which you even taught me to cook, the special roasted yam with okro and ukpaka delicacy, and abacha you always prepared for me whenever I visited, the warmth in your voice when you spoke to us your children ? I can go on and on and on. Hmmmmmm! Death! My Dearest Mum, I am consoled by the fact that you lived a good life while on earth. The rest of your legacy is left for us your children to carry on.

Office, Nwanyi obioma, action mama, Madam Newlife - Rest in the bosom of the Lord. May the good Lord and His Angels welcome you home till we meet again!
I will surely miss you!

### TRIBUTE TO A GREAT MOTHER, MADAM ELIZABETH ILO (aka OFFICE)

It was a moment of sadness that took me through a long memory lane when I heard the sad news of your demise. My heart was filled with pains that a great woman, a wonderful mother has departed from us. But the pains disappeared quickly when I remembered how beautifully you lived your life.

I remembered how you treated strangers like me in house at Presidential road, Enugu, how you welcomed me as if I was one of your daughter too during my University days. I remembered your beautiful smiles and I have no doubt you have gone to be with our Great God. You welcomed strangers like me in your home and treat us as family members.
Mummy, It was a wonderful experience for me especially whenever I heard Daddy calls you ‚Äò‚Äô A Darling‚Äô‚Äô I usually enjoy the sweet smiles that radiate from your face. I have always teased your daughter Uchenna my friend about that and we will all smile over it. Mama Ngoo, you lived an exemplary life, a life a cheerfulness and gratitude. May God and His angles lead you Home and bless your soul forever. Amen.
Goodnight ‚Äò‚ÄôA Darling‚Äô‚Äô
Goodnight ‚Äò‚ÄôOFFICE‚Äô‚Äô
Goodnight Great Mother
