Dear Dr Somtoochukwu ILO & Family

We your friends  would like to convey our sincere condolence to you, your family and the entire Ezioko village, OKO Town in Orumba LGA of Anambra State  on the passing of  your  dear mum, Madam Elizabeth Mgbechikwelu ILO ( OFFICE) .   We know this is uncertain and emotionally difficult time to your family and entire OKO community, considering her dedication to family life and community development.
The news of her death came to us as a shock, leaving us with a disturbing question why  is it good things don't last?  You are one mother that appreciate having your son's friends around you. We call you  office because of the way we interact freely  and make jokes with you even in the absence of our friend, making us feel comfortable and accepted. You would  always ask us, umum un emeriena onwunwa nke taa? your readiness to offer us cold water  to calm our head is a gesture many of us will not forget. Mama we will miss your gentle  affectious smile that always tell us that we are welcome. Ezinne office ga nke oma and may the good Lord grant you eternal rest.

The Loss of such a great woman is beyond words. OFFICE was a great woman of remarkable qualities, a true icon and a woman of huge courage. Her life story epitomises a woman who put others before self, often at a great personal sacrifice. A true definition of perseverance and selfless  duty .

We can only but imagine the emptiness she left  in your life, your siblings, grandchildren and her beloved  husband

Mama's demise is a huge loss that cannot be compensated but let us be consoled by her legacies and  numerous positive impacts on earth and take solace that she had lived a good life and deserves a place in the bosom of our lord Jesus Christ.

At this difficult time, please accept our condolence and extend same to your Dad, siblings and entire ILO family. It was an honour for us to have known your Mum and benefited from her knowledge and humour.

Yours sincerely
## Tom Ekene Ogbu and Igwe Dominic  for Committee of Friends
