My grandmother you were and will always be the best grandma one can ask for in this life. You are always there for us your grand children, always making funny jokes. You will tell us the right thing when you see that we are not doing something/things right.
I still remember our last conversation when we met in our last visit on 25th December, 2020 which was last year Christmas. Grandmummy told me I should always do the right thing and not follow bad friends.
On 11th January, 2021, I was still rejoicing and thanking God for the gift of the new, only to hear that you are dead. I could not say anthing, i just stood there moping at nothing.
Grandma I wish you a perfect rest in the bossom of our lord Jesus christ and may your soul rest in perfect peace, Amen.

Your baby

TRIBUTE TO  MY RESILENT HEROINE 

My grandmother, a great woman who I  accorded great respect without limits or boundaries has taken her path to a blissful rest.

Mama you have always been a woman full of love, compassion, trust and cheerfulness. You are not only my  teacher, you are also my mentor and  leader.

Life is a mystery that is only known to God. To Him we owe all things. Our days are numbered by Him and the decision is His alone. No man can question him.

Your death came as a shock, but I know that love and beautiful memories outlast pains and grief. You will forever remain green in my memory .

FARE WELL GRANDMA

LETTER TO BIG MUMMY

 Big Mummy, i did not see you for once. I wanted my Aunty to take me to you so that l can make your hair. I did not see you before you died. I will miss you so much.

 My Aunty is very sorry for not taking me to see you. I wish you did not die so that you can see how I look. It pains me so much because you have never seen me. I wish they will allow me to look inside the casket to see how you look but am very sure they will not allow me. 

 Big Mummy, may your soul rest in peace. I miss you so much.

TRIBUTE TO MY TREASURED GRANDMA

This is a post that is difficult for me to write due to shock that engulfed me since l got the news that you are gone.

Recently, l lost you, my beloved grandmother as you passed away on 11th January, 2021 of sudden brief fever and l am missing you especially as l stay with you day in, day out, currently living with you. I was there, when grand daddy took you to the hospital, and l never knew you will not come back to the house again. You were taken to the hospital in the afternoon and by evening of that same day, you were gone.

You were one special lady/woman and the loss of you is felt deeply by many, even though, you lived a full life. Seeing you being sick mostly due to ageing was extremely depressing to me. The love of a grandmummy is unique. God must have given grandmothers to us to lighten up our lives, to make our lives more complete, to make us well rounded, and better human beings.

You played a big part in my childhood and l can remember many times sitting in your shop and playing with you. You taught me a lot about life and the meaning of family. You have never been just 'grandmother', but also my guardian, my friend and my inspirator.

I miss you, grandmum.

Your Cherished grandson
