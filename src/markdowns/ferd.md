Death an expected end of every mortal has once again taken away a virtuous woman and created a vacuum that will be very difficult to fill. The lessons of love, tolerance, sincerity and peace we learned from you can not be forgotten in a hurry. We will miss your motherly advice that is always timely, your spiritual support and gentle disposition.

Indeed, your peaceful resolution of crisis which you had impacted in me, will ever remain indelible. Your advice in time of trouble, Jirinu nwayo, adighi m acho nsowu; meaning take life easy, am not a troublesome person, will ever remain a guide in all my actions.

Sleep in the Lord, epitome of love. Adieu, beauty personified. laa nke oma Ochiora.

YOUR SON IN-LAW
