What tribute can I write that will express fully the love and care you showed me.

Â  Office, as I fondly call you. I will miss you . A mother that loves me so much and will always call us ( My Wife and I) on phone to know how we are doing. You never cease to send something to me once my wife comes visiting. Who will pray and book holy mass for us. Am consoled that you are in a better place.

ADIEU OFFICE.
