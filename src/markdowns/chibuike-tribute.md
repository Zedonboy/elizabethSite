What tribute can I write that will express fully the love and care you showed me.

  Office, as I fondly call you. I will miss you . A mother that loves me so much and will always call us ( My Wife and I) on phone to know how we are doing. You never cease to send something to me once my wife comes visiting. Who will pray and book holy mass for us. Am consoled that you are in a better place.

ADIEU OFFICE.

TRIBUTE TO OUR GRAND MOTHER 

Grandmummy who said you are dead? We thought they said good people don't die. Grandmummy who will play and chase us around with cane. Grandmummy who will give us biscuit, gala, mineral, and Money like you used to.

The news of your death came to us as a shock even as little as we are. Who will be our next Grandmummy. We are going to miss you so much. We your grandsons love you and pray that God will receive your soul and grant you Eternal rest in his bossom.

Goodbye Grandmummy 

Your grandchildren
