Dear Mum,
How is heaven? I'm sure you have settled in. I received the unexpected news of your passing into Glory that night from Engr Doc. Ilo and Engr. Emfeka Ejiofor (Gentle) I paced up and down, stayed quiet for some minutes. Then my body started shaking. My joints became weak. Suddenly, I screamed, I wailed, I wept throughout the night until there were no fluid left in my system.

Before the news of your death. The thought of "Rest in peace Mum" kept interrupting my thoughts but heaven knows that I would not want to imagine or think of that, so in the silence of my heart. I kept on praying against it.

That very day, we did our daily routine of either you or I calling ourselves. We exchanged pleasantries. And I reassured you of our previous schedule to visit you . My husband and I were to visit you within the next three days, since we did not come during Christmas. You had looked forward to that day. But alas, heaven has urgent need of you.

Mummy, I wish I was at your bed side in the hospital. I wish I had sang the song you always enjoyed from me, which goes thus:

Office gini onye na-azo?

Office gini onye na-azo?

E kwuru ka araru, ka o je kwaru oge.
Mummy, I pleaded with you to follow me to my base so that I can give you proper attention but you refused, asking who will cook and look after your Darlyn, my Daddy.

Oke nne m, you were not in competition with anyone. You would always say be contented with what you have. Mummy, how come you never condemned anybody's child even when the person was clearly bad ?

You never cease to say your rosary when you are alone. Mummy, You were a women leader both in the Village and at the City. You take center stage in any organisation you found yourself.

I miss you dearly, this period. I miss your smiles, your laugh, your cheers, your encouragement, your support, your prayers, your admirations, your fights with me. When I want to get rid of your old stuff. You would never let me throw them away you would say, " Uche hapulum ihem"

My life has not been the same. Tears drop from my eyes unconsciously. I now keep to my self . I have suddenly become an introvert . How can I be consoled? Your prayers and wishes for me are yet to be fulfilled. Who will call my line everyday and enquire how am doing? Your Daughters Ngozi , Ify , Uso and Nkiruka have been in pains of loosing you. Somtoo, your only son is trying to be a man, his heart is broken . Then my Dad, your Darlyn cannot be consoled. I pray for a special blessing on him and the grace to withstand this irreparable loss. As for me, Uche, my heart is heavy and I feel empty.
Mummy m, as Jacob mourned for his son Joseph and refused to be consoled in Gen. 37:34-36 so it has been with me. Mum, you prepared yourself so well for this heavenly journey and I take my peace from there.
I love you so much. Nevertheless, as it pleased God Almighty to call you to him. I strongly believe you are happy there.

Jee nke oma Office Oke nwanyi.
Jee nke oma Nne m oma.
Jee nke oma Nne ora.

Your daughter,
## Uche Chibuike Chukwurah.
Last daughter.
