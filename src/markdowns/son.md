My super  Mummy. The best of all the mamas in the world.

Mama anyi, '' Office Nkem'', my heart bleeds. it has been difficult for me to concentrate and write anything. The reality of the glaring truth is just way too hard for me to take. I cannot think straight.  The fond moments we shared keep flooding my thought.

Mummy, I lack words, I miss you, I love you.

Goodnight mummy rest on in the bossom of our lord, till we meet again at the dawn of a new glory in God’s kingdom.


Your son
