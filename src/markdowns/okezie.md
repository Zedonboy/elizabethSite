It is sad, that I am writing this piece in honour  of late Chief (Mrs) Elizabeth ILO, Office Umuagbara (Office of Women of Substance).

I met her as a 10years old boy in the 1st quarter, of 1992, and  one striking character of her, I appreciated so much, is teaching you what you are meant to do by doing that which you failed to do.

Those days, were days, I refer as discipline years, were my parents taught me to greet everybody, talk of an Aunty, Uncle or any elder with goodmorning sir or ma. (the emphasis here is on sir or ma, depending on the sex) Now in Office's  case, that is, Chief Mrs Elizabeth Iloh, when I inadvertently forget to add the phrase  ma, when I greet her, she will respond by saying,

''Okezie goodmorning sir".

Her above response, in my humble view is training a child,  which I was as that time, with love, she is one of those reformers, aside my parents, that will ask me questions, on why my school uniform is dirty when I come from school, the great old white and blue, 'College of Immaculate conception Enugu, if my answer is not satisfactory, she will instruct me to hold my two ears, when i do, she will quietly tell me not to stain my school uniform again, that my parents spend  money to buy soap and detergent for the washing of my school uniforms.

This great task of keeping my white and blue clean, was so much on me because my parents were there to discipline me and Office was there as well, it is instructive to note that am one of the neatest Counsel East of the Niger, thanks to God Almighty, my parents, Chief Mrs Elizabeth Iloh and my own humble effort.

Am grateful to Almighty God, that in the last 14 years, I have been a Solicitor and Advocate of Supreme Court of Nigeria, that, my parents, though late now, and Chief Mrs Elizabeth Ilo, have not, corrected me, with respect to adding the usual ma or sir when I greet them  or ask me why my sparkling white shirt is dirt, because the discipline planted in me during my formative  age is still my compass.

Her death on 11th day of January 2021, is not accidental, rather, in my view  our Lord Jesus Christ and his father, Almighty God, approved same, because God have been sustaining her all through her life, till the above mentioned date, she answered her God.

To Chief Francis Ilo, whom she calls Darling, her children and especially Dr. Tochukwu Ilo, who are products of moral upbringing, should take solace, that at the last day, we will all meet at the beautiful gate, where sorrow will not be entertained again, Amen.
