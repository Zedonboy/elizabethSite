My heart is maimed, I am broken. The loss of my wonderful, adorable mother is an indescribable pain to bear. Mummy, Office, mother in a million, mother like no other, mother that will do whatever it takes to make her children happy, you have left a void so difficult to fill, an indelible ache for me.

You were my model, my mentor, my encourager, my advicer, my friend, my strength at all times especially when I am down and out. You taught me to live with moral and values in an ever changing dynamic world. On whose shoulders will I cry when the need arises? Who will I run to that will understand me as you do? Who will ever fill the gap of your motherly love? Who will be there to advice me? Who again will I call

Office  Umuagbara  
Office  Ezi nwanyi  
Office Oke nwanyi  
Office Oke nnem  
Office Ezi  nnem  
Office Onye oga diri na mma  
Office Onye o diri n'nma  

I recall our discussion over the phone on the Friday before your death. As usual you told me we should not worry about you but concentrate on ourselves. You promised me you will take the diet required of you as to be strong. The good times we had together and good legacies are memories I will forever hold dear in my heart.

It was on the morning of the Monday you died that  I received the items you sent to me through my sister that visited home for Christmas. I have not even called to say thank you only to be informed of your health condition. In the afternoon of same day, I was informed you are now stable and I was very happy, only to be told latter in the day that you  were no more. The news of your death shocked me beyond words.

Death I know is an inevitable debt we will all pay but Office, yours took me by surprise. I always saw you as a very strong woman, of which you were and never in my widest dream did I forsee your demise too soon. I thought you would defeat the fangs of death that snatched you this soon. Your grandson  Chukwuemeka still cabnot believe you are gone. He keeps telling me grand mummy is a very strong woman, she can't die like that.

Death has dealt  me a severe blow by taking you away  at this time when you are yet to reap the full fruit of your labour from me. Death why have you done this? Mum, there are still many things I needed to do for you to show how grateful I am for all you have done especially by raising me a strong woman. You were a great   sculptor, you played a pivotal role in shaping up the woman I have become. You inculcated the following attributes in my siblings and I God fearing, hardworking, honesty and responsibility. You thought us humility, selflessness, charity, love of  neighbour and that prayer supercedes everything. You were known for simplicity, kindness, generosity, amiability and love for downtrodden. You were ever ready to welcome people into your home. You touched many lives positively.

My sweet mother, you were a precious gift from God, so much beauty, grace, love, examplarly humility, peace and patience. You touched many hearts in so many ways. Your prayers on dark days made me realize I have an angle beside me. God who gave you has decided to take you away at this time. No one can question his authority, He knows the best. I will sincerely miss you.I know we will meet to part no more on the resurrection day. 

My prayer is that God Almighty, the good Lord whom you served so well in His infinite mercy will grant you eternal rest in His bossom. Amen
May your gentle soul rest in perfect peace. Amen.
Now I am consoled by the fact that I now have another guardian angel watching over us.

I love you to the moon and back.
