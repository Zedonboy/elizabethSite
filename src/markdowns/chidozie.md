Office Nwanyi, so it is true that you are no more, I have restrained myself from writing this piece thinking that it is a dream wishing that someone should wake me but as the day passed it dawned on me that you are truly gone and I will not see you again in this present world.

Office Nwanyi, You were a Virtous Woman,the Mother of my Wife, a role model for every mother in law, a source of inspiration for the young Mothers and most importantly a stunch Christian and Catholic with an unalloyed devotion to the rosary and our blessed mother Mary.

Office Nwanyi, now that you are no more who will be Mummy Enugu for us, who will prepare and send to us those delicious delicacies from the coal city, who will we call and run to when we need those Office advise, you were the best in what you did and we will always be proud of you.

Office Nwanyi, your children are broken,your grand children are still in shock because you have left a gap too hard to fill and a shoe too big to wear but we take solace in the belief than you have departed to a place far much better than this wicked world where the good do not last.

Office Nwanyi, Circumstances did not afford me the opportunity and luxury to know and enjoy most of you but with the little that I was able to grasp I will cherish forever. In my next world if there be, You will still be my mother in law.

Office Nwanyi, Naa Na Udo,

Office Nwanyi, Jee Nke Oma,

Office Nwanyi, Rest In Peace until we meet to part no more.



Your Son in Law,

## Chiedozie Nwafor
