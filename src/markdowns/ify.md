Mummy we weep bitterly but we smile at the same time.
We weep because we will no longer physically feel your love, kindness and guidance and miss you deeply. However, we smile
because of the many gifts you left for us trust in God, hardwork, showing love and kindness to your family and the world.
Mummy you are the best, you are perfect in every way. May the Lord in his mercy grant you eternal rest in his bosom.
Amen.
